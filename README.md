### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and XMPP
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Free Software
- 📫 How to reach me: via XMPP (E**X**tensible **M**essaging and **P**resence **P**rotocol)

### E-Mail

If you didn't, you should try [neomutt](https://neomutt.org/)! It's my favorite mail client 📬️!

### Instant messaging

Instant messaging is very nice for real-time communication. For instant  messaging I prefer XMPP. 
[Gajim](https://gajim.org/) and [Dino](https://dino.im/) are nice GUI Client for XMPP. 
I like the console based Client [profanity](https://profanity-im.github.io/).
